# Decky Interval Timer

A simple plugin that shows a popup every 5 mins, during a time period you choose.

To adjust: tap start/end time, then plus/minus buttons to match desired.

Open to PR's/feature requests! Very much bootstrapped to suit my needs, can improve if useful :).

This is a simple decky plugin to allow you to set an alarm to interrupt your experience.
Maybe you're cooking dinner, or have an appointment. Who knows? Someone's got to pull you away though!

`pnpm run build`
or
`pnpm run watch`
